        <h2 id="first-actual-post">Week 4 - Conversations Reflection</h2>
        <p><strong>3 October 2019</strong></p>

        <p>In my first conversation, I attempted to practice the roles of Mover and Opposer, which tend to be 
            the actions I take least often. The setting was a weekly touch-base with other Product Managers at 
            my company and our goal was to brainstorm some solutions to a particular problem and then form 
            groups to execute on some of the ideas. It was an interesting environment due to only a few people 
            being physically present, while others called in from other locations. We weren’t able to take 
            advantage of video conferencing, so it became an unusual juggling act of engaging some participants 
            face to face and others through mere disembodied voices. While I can comfortably play the role of 
            Mover at times, I still struggle with challenging others as an Opposer. My primary tendency, when 
            offering an opposing opinion, is to approach it in the form of questions. This approach may 
            straddle the lines of Following and Opposing, in contrast with pure Opposing actions. While that 
            may seem to soften the blow of critical feedback, there’s still plenty of room for improvement in 
            my capacity to challenge others effectively.</p>

        <p>The second conversation was by far the most intriguing. I prepared a handful of brief slides to 
            cover the content of the Four Player Model and facilitated a discussion with four of my coworkers 
            around the associated concepts. I encouraged them to ask questions as they came up and requested 
            that they specifically share what points resonated with them and which points didn’t. A couple of 
            ideas were particularly interesting - the goal of the visual and the difficulty of suspending. 
            While talking through the actions it seemed relatively straightforward that Movers and Opposers 
            were, in a sense, on opposite ends of a spectrum. The confusion surfaced while unpacking Bystanders 
            and Followers - are they similarly diametrically opposed? We didn’t let the question keep us from 
            moving forward through the content, but we weren’t able to come to any sort of agreement on what 
            the visual was attempting to communicate. The second idea I found to be interesting was that 
            suspending is likely the most difficult skill to master among the four practices. It is enough 
            of a challenge to suspend our beliefs about what others are saying, but even more so it is 
            exceptionally difficult to suspend our beliefs about what we, ourselves, are saying. I would 
            agree that such a level of awareness requires a significant amount of work to cultivate and is 
            potentially the most useful practice to learn.</p>

        <p>The third conversation was with somebody I have had a hard time communicating with throughout 
            the recent few weeks. It was ad-hoc and relatively unstructured but surprisingly went very well. 
            I mostly took the role of the Mover, but frequently asked him what I might be missing, in an 
            attempt to encourage him to Follow and Oppose. Despite being a brief conversation, I think it 
            was the first successful interaction I’ve had with this person yet. He even mentioned at the end 
            of our chat that it was a pleasant surprise and I should swing by more often.</p>

        <h2 id="first-actual-post">Week 3 - Coach Call</h2>
        <p><strong>28 September 2019</strong></p>

        <p>For my first experience of being a coach, this week’s coaching call certainly exceeded my 
            expectations! My initial expectation was that the conversation might feel somewhat forced or 
            awkward at moments, but it seemed to flow relatively freely from one topic to the next. It’s 
            hard to say what the biggest contributors might have been, but I do believe my coachee is an 
            easy person to have a conversation with, which is a good start.</p>

        <p>From my side, I believe I did a decent job listening, summarizing and questioning, even attempt 
            to catalyze on one topic which may or may not have resonated. Some of the effects may only 
            manifest with time. One key process I do not think I engaged in was “mirroring.” Initially, 
            I did not remember what it entailed, but having read over it again I find myself struggling 
            with the definition. It seems to significantly overlap with questioning, which means I may just 
            have to spend more time digging into it to understand how to employ it more effectively.</p> 

        <p>By the end of the call, my coachee mentioned he had enjoyed the conversation and it had helped him 
            think about things differently. We closed by discussing what my role might look like as a coach 
            going forward and it seems to revolve around helping see things at a higher level - asking questions 
            like “where do you want to go with this?”, “what is your end goal?”, “where are you now?”, and “where 
            do you want to go next?” These questions could help ensure deliberate orientation as we travel 
            through the course material and look for opportunities to apply it within our individual lives.</p>

        <h2 id="first-actual-post">Week 3 - Coachee Call</h2>
        <p><strong>28 September 2019</strong></p>

        <p>What is it like to be coached? What should it be like? These questions seemed to be driving 
            the call for this first coaching session. With each of us being new to the concept of coaching, 
            we began with significant room to grow. The session turned into a wonderful opportunity for 
            each of us to explore different ideas around what to expect from a coach.</p>

        <p>One interesting concept my coach mentioned was from material covered earlier in the course. 
            The idea was that we shouldn’t necessarily expect to leave each conversation with an answer 
            to whatever question we entered it with. Tying this in with coaching, should the expectation 
            be that a coach helps their coachee toward resolving some particular issue or question? Is 
            resolution even the goal?</p>

        <p>The lecture for the week states that the job of a coach is to “support the learning” of the person 
          they are coaching and to help their coachee “reflect on the communication practices” in each assignment. 
          These goals seem to support the idea that coaching is potentially less about problem-solving and more 
          about problem-discussion.</p>

        <p>These ideas shifted my characterization of coaching by emphasizing the role of a coach as a guide, or 
            a partner, in moving forward toward a better understanding of the topics at hand. A complete 
            understanding by the end of each call is not the expectation, rather the coach acts as a catalyst 
            for articulating ideas differently or reframing ideas in ways which allow the coachee to explore 
            them from new angles.</p>

        <h2 id="first-actual-post">Week 3 - Coaching Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>24 September 2019</strong></p>

        <p>In his book Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together, Bill Isaacs states: “we can influence 
            and regenerate the inner ecology of human beings by transforming the quality of our conversations” 
            (pg. 308). Even more directly, “the way we talk impacts the way we think.” A good coach is someone 
            who encourages the kind of dialogue which helps a person regenerate their inner ecology. Through 
            tactics like active listening, summarizing, and questioning, a coach is able to assist another 
            person toward a better articulation of their thoughts and feelings. While it’s a deeply collaborative 
            effort, the coach will likely spend most of the conversation using prompts to help their coachee work 
            through something for which they haven’t quite found the words.</p>

        <p>This process of “thinking together” can have a profound effect on the coachee, as Bill Isaacs describes 
            it: “to help human beings to untie their own knots and liberate themselves” (pg. ix). This process 
            includes helping a person reflect on their thoughts, discover the source of their ideas and uncover 
            ways they might more fully express themselves in a truthful and articulate manner. It is a partnership 
            in unraveling the mystery surrounding an individual and their thought process. This would then, in turn, 
            alter the way the coachee sees the world and allow them to discover new ways of understanding their 
            surroundings and other people.</p>

        <p>For me, a great coach would help me to better understand the way I am perceived by, and interact with, 
            other people. My occupation requires a good portion of my time to be filled with the creation and 
            maintaining of human relationships, from members of my direct team to various stakeholders. It also 
            includes customers and other end-users with whom I interact on a regular basis in order to understand 
            their needs and concerns. Each of these interactions could be improved by transforming the quality of 
            conversation and learning how to better engage in generative dialogue. We’re often navigating through 
            complex spaces with potentially opposing goals, searching for some semblance of common ground. While I 
            have been relatively successful in building relationships in the recent past, there is still plenty of 
            opportunity to connect with others on a deeper, more human level.</p>

        <p>Lastly, I believe a good coach is somebody who eventually makes themselves irrelevant. The process of 
            supporting someone through the untying of their own knots and liberating themselves should include 
            putting structures in place which no longer necessitate the further assistance of the coach. In fact, 
            the coachee should be aware of what elements of the dialogue are helping them and how, so they can 
            continue to improve while outside the safety net of a coach’s conversation. This process should lead 
            to a regenerated inner ecology which can, in turn, reach out to and improve the inner ecology of other 
            human beings. “Change in one part of that ecology can have impacts on the whole of the ecology, 
            precisely because it is a living system” (pg. 308). The end-goal of the coach should be a positive 
            shift in the ecology which goes on to affect the entire system.</p>
