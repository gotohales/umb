        <h2 id="first-actual-post">Week 3 - Coaching Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>24 September 2019</strong></p>

        <p>In his book Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together, Bill Isaacs states: “we can influence 
            and regenerate the inner ecology of human beings by transforming the quality of our conversations” 
            (pg. 308). Even more directly, “the way we talk impacts the way we think.” A good coach is someone 
            who encourages the kind of dialogue which helps a person regenerate their inner ecology. Through 
            tactics like active listening, summarizing, and questioning, a coach is able to assist another 
            person toward a better articulation of their thoughts and feelings. While it’s a deeply collaborative 
            effort, the coach will likely spend most of the conversation using prompts to help their coachee work 
            through something for which they haven’t quite found the words.</p>

        <p>This process of “thinking together” can have a profound effect on the coachee, as Bill Isaacs describes 
            it: “to help human beings to untie their own knots and liberate themselves” (pg. ix). This process 
            includes helping a person reflect on their thoughts, discover the source of their ideas and uncover 
            ways they might more fully express themselves in a truthful and articulate manner. It is a partnership 
            in unraveling the mystery surrounding an individual and their thought process. This would then, in turn, 
            alter the way the coachee sees the world and allow them to discover new ways of understanding their 
            surroundings and other people.</p>

        <p>For me, a great coach would help me to better understand the way I am perceived by, and interact with, 
            other people. My occupation requires a good portion of my time to be filled with the creation and 
            maintaining of human relationships, from members of my direct team to various stakeholders. It also 
            includes customers and other end-users with whom I interact on a regular basis in order to understand 
            their needs and concerns. Each of these interactions could be improved by transforming the quality of 
            conversation and learning how to better engage in generative dialogue. We’re often navigating through 
            complex spaces with potentially opposing goals, searching for some semblance of common ground. While I 
            have been relatively successful in building relationships in the recent past, there is still plenty of 
            opportunity to connect with others on a deeper, more human level.</p>

        <p>Lastly, I believe a good coach is somebody who eventually makes themselves irrelevant. The process of 
            supporting someone through the untying of their own knots and liberating themselves should include 
            putting structures in place which no longer necessitate the further assistance of the coach. In fact, 
            the coachee should be aware of what elements of the dialogue are helping them and how, so they can 
            continue to improve while outside the safety net of a coach’s conversation. This process should lead 
            to a regenerated inner ecology which can, in turn, reach out to and improve the inner ecology of other 
            human beings. “Change in one part of that ecology can have impacts on the whole of the ecology, 
            precisely because it is a living system” (pg. 308). The end-goal of the coach should be a positive 
            shift in the ecology which goes on to affect the entire system.</p>

        <p>Welcome to my first actual post!</p>

        <p>This is primarily a test post to make sure the blog is set up correctly and ready to be filled with 
            content. Posts will continue to appear here as exercises and assignments require. I am looking forward
            seeing the content here grow!
        </p>

        <p>Cheers!</p>
